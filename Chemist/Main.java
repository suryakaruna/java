You have been hired as a software consultant at a chemist. The chemist shop 
sells various types of compounds and mixture to their customers. They have a
research team that put together various formulas for the chemist of sell. 
The owner of the shop is a bit of stickler for cleanliness and is also afraid 
of unforeseen reactions when creating the compounds. So,she has created a rule
where a new mixing can is to used for creating a new compound (whether the 
compound is made of the base elements or from another set of pre-made compounds).
Your job as a consultant is to determine the minimal number of bowls that are 
required to make them. Any compound/element that is part of a definition, without 
its own definition can be assumed to be a base element. base elements donâ€™t need any preparation.

Multiline input. Where first line N specifies the number of compound definitions 
followed by N definitions. Followed. Followed by integer M specifies the number of 
compounds to prepare and M compounds to prepare.


Calculate the minimum number of bowls required to prepared the given compounds.
